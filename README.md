# DiscreteFourierTransform
Discrete fourier transform(DFTs) or Fast fourier transforms(FFTs) is an algorithm used to covert the signal or an input function from a time or space domain to its frequency domain.
## How to run it
This is a matlab script so you need to have access to Mathmorks-Matlab to run it. 

If you do have access, DFT.m is the main script that you need to run.
## What does this program do?
This program(DFT.m) contructs a signal or input function and through the `fft()` and the `ifft()` function recontructs the signal using windowing.
